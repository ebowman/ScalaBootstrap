Gilt/AOL Hackathon Scala Starter

This should "just work" once you've cloned this repo.

I've written a little scala program using actors via Akka, for searching for a
keyword in Gilt's active & upcoming sales feeds.

To run it, from a bash shell, do:

./sbt

This will start Simple Build Tool, and after downloading a few things, it
should give you a prompt like:

>

Type run, follows by a search term:

> run boots

The program should output the sale title and URL of all sales which had the
word "boots" in the sale description, something like:

> run boots
